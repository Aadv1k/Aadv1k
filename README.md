# hello;
Not much to say about me other than the fact that im your average enjoyer, not a fan, not a hater; just an enjoyer, same goes for everything else I do here.
 
# Stuff i know;
- Python 🐍
- JavaScript <img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/devicons/devicon/icons/javascript/javascript-original.svg" align="center" width="15"/>
- Vim 🐱‍💻 

# Stuff i do;
- Automate stuff with python.
- _ricing_ my (neo)vim setup
- Chilling out on cssbattle.dev by hard coding every element
- Bicker about the _bloated modern web_ as an excuse to my bad css skills. 

Feel free to argue with me about the _bloated modern web_ on my [Twitter](https://twitter.com/aadv1k) or [Email](mailto:aadv1k@outlook.com)
