Hey, this is Aadvik! I primarily do **Tech** (good cup of latte â˜•). Currently I am working with **Web Development** and **Computer Vision**. I also occasionally write at [aadvik's wicked blog](https://aadv1k.netlify.app/).

Feel free to reach out and say hi via [email](mailto:aadv1k@outlook.com)

## now

I am trying to get good at Computer Vision (and Web Dev); This is how

- Building an [experimental Computer Vision library](https://github.com/aadv1k/deimos) in C
- Messing around with WebAssembly and CV by building [a web-based document scanner](https://github.com/aadv1k/deimos) 
- Writing a [Computer Vision Guide](https://aadv1k.gitbook.io/cv-guide) alongside for future reference

## future

- (?) Creating 3D enviroments from stero scans of the enviorment
- (?) Using generative AI to fill in gaps of 3D enviroments
