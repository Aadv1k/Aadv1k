Hi, I am Aadvik, just someone from **India** who happens to be interested in techy things, such as 
- Hacking up my [vimrc](https://gist.github.com/Aadv1k/ec7dbe9e0d2ef5c50c9613020503527c) and developing plugins for **vim**.
- Building sites for the **world wide web**, that are responsive and *sassy* ðŸ’…. 
- Constantly trying to automate those mundane tasks w/ **python**. 
- Learning and filling up my brain with ***tech jargon*** everyday (except weekends). 
- Trying to put whatever *crackbrained* idea that my brain comes up with into code.  

### Some of the things I have done
- [Reddit text to speech gui](https://github.com/Aadv1k/reddit-tts-gui) - A **gui program** to generate text to speech videos from reddit. 
- [gdoc.vim](https://github.com/Aadv1k/gdoc.vim) - A **vim plugin** that provides google docs integration. 
- [schoolOS API Wrapper](https://github.com/Aadv1k/schoolOS-api-wrapper) - An **unofficial Api wrapper** made for [schoolOS](https://www.toppr.school/).
