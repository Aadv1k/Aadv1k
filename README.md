Hey, this is Aadvik, I _really_ love writing code! (especially with a good cup of latte ☕). Currently I am working with **Web Development** and **Computer Vision**. I also occasionally write at [aadvik's wicked blog](https://aadv1k.netlify.app/).

## Life update

For the past two months, I have been stuck in the entrails of an uninspired, unmotivated rut; I started three projects, none of which I was able to conclude to a satisfactory degree. As with many things, this too was self-imposed, courtesy of the perfectionist and procrastinator in me engaged in a dance of starting a project, being dissatisfied with an aspect of it, starting over, or trying to rebuild another aspect of it. 'Recursive Hell' is a term I coin for such ruts; you start a project with some ambition for it, get stuck on some aspect, and then decide to tackle another ambitious task to overhaul that 'aspect' of it. This way, each task spawns another drain, another rabbit hole

What's next for me? I've decided to take a break from the vicious cycle of attempting to work, getting distracted, and inevitably wasting time doomscrolling the internet. Instead, I plan to read-up on some books, practice mindfulness, and eagerly await Advent Of Code 2023, an yearly  event in my ongoing love affair with programming.

## Now

Planning stuff, archiving and wrapping up past baggage.   

## Past

Here are some of my notable projects

I maintain a monorepo of [frontend-projects](https://github.com/aadv1k/frontend-projects), these are implementations of various designs from across the web, the tech-stack ranges from Webpack w/ Vanilla JS, to full-on React apps.

**18/08/2023** [OctetOCR](https://github.com/aadv1k/octet) is a rather simple OCR model (and data preparation system) in C which uses [KNN](https://www.ibm.com/topics/knn) algorithm to approximate an input image with it's labeled training data

**11/08/2023** [swt.h](https://github.com/aadv1k/swt) is a header-only, zero-dependency implementation for Stroke Width Transform, which allows for text extraction from scenes

**10/07/2023** I wrote a [Computer Vision Guide](https://aadv1k.gitbook.io/cv-guide) that documents much of the functions, and techniques I learn about Computer Vision while building [Deimos](https://github.com/aadv1k/deimos) (which is a CV library in C)

**24/06/2023** [Chex](https://github.com/aadv1k/chex) is a simple chess engine, that offers a web + console UI, which I wrote to mess around with C++ and some of the [design patterns](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns) I had been studying

**24/04/2023** [Beaver](https://github.com/aadv1k/beaver) is a CSV data manipulation library written in [Common Lisp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Lisp)

**09/05/2023** Wrote a search query parser [@byod/dork](https://github.com/aadv1k/byod/tree/main/dork) similar to what search engines use; it primarily srves to remove filler words and distill the language into one which is more deterministic.

**14/04/2023** [DracoQL](https://github.com/aadv1k/dracoql) is a DSL (Domain specific language) in TypeScript comprising of an AST built upon a rudimentary tokenizer. The AST is interpreted by the JS and the results are either piped into the namespace (which is really just a Map) or to the `stdout`.

**15/12/2022** 🎄 [Advent of Code in C](https://github.com/Aadv1k/AdventOfC2022)

**11/09/2022** Wrote [kevlar](https://github.com/aadv1k/kevlar) a **static-site generator** using pure C, this project comprises of several smaller chunks, each built from scratch :-
- A minimal and fast markdown parser, which you can download -> [md2html](https://github.com/Aadv1k/kevlar/releases/tag/v2.0.1)
- A non-spec [`.ini` parser](https://github.com/Aadv1k/kevlar#config)
- The [Kevlar templating engine](https://github.com/Aadv1k/kevlar#templating), heavily inspired from hugo
- The [default kevlar theme](https://github.com/Aadv1k/listed-kevlar-theme)

**17/02/2022** [Gdoc.vim](https://github.com/aadv1k/gdoc.vim) is a plugin provides google docs integration for the Vim editor, it supports all the CRUD operations from a editor first approach.

**24/12/2021** [Advent of Code in Lua](https://github.com/Aadv1k/AdventOfLua2021)

**05/10/2021** Reverse engineered and [wrote a wrapper](https://github.com/Aadv1k/schoolOS-api-wrapper) for [SchoolOS](https://www.getschoolos.com/), which at the time was the site being used by my school for online classes.

## Future

- Advent of code 2023 in (Rust/Go/Lisp/Haskell)?
