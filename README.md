A monologue about my journey...<br>
I first stumbled across programming when I was scrolling through youtube, around 2019 was when I wrote my first line of code in python. It all went up from there, eventually I transitioned onto web development simple because I wanted everyone to see the sites I built.
It was in 2021 when I created my github profile and started my open source journy by creating some projects. managing school alongside my evergrowing "obsession" with programming was hard, but I got around it. Currently I am building my frontend skillset by working on projects.
