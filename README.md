Hey, this is Aadvik, and I love building (and breaking) stuff (usually tech).  Currently I am involved in the web dev space, but you might find me doing anything from low-level C dev, to writing scripts to automate the _drudgerous_ parts of my life! I also occasionally write at [aadvik's wicked blog](https://aadv1k.netlify.app/). ( ask me how it's built :] )

## Now

- **08/12/2025** Did [Advent of Code 2025 in C++](https://github.com/aadv1k/AdventOfCpp2025) 

- **05/10/2025** Built [Biome](https://github.com/aadv1k/nasa-Biome) my solo-entry into NASA Space Apps hackathon; Here I built a (slighly overengineered) LLM-based ETL pipeline to process approx ~680 space biology research paper into quantified and structured JSON data for analysis. I then used this data-set to build a graph where clustering represented how semantically, categorically similar two papers were, the size of nodes showed how many citations have been made TO the paper. The data also includes the right fields and parameters to do a contradiction analysis, (given similar conditions and sample sizes, do the results match?)  and a lot more, which I was unable to truly justify due to the constrained time-limit.

- **24/09/2025** Built [sih-VanaRaj](https://github.com/aadv1k/sih-VanaRaj) our entry for SIH '25. This involved learning about GeoJSON and how WebGIS works, and a lot of manual data collection to build an interactive "atlas" for tribal people, hosted live at [sih.aadvikpandey.com](https://sih.aadvikpandey.com)

## Past

### 2024

- **29/11/2024** Built [Varta](https://github.com/aadv1k/varta) a multi-channel school communications app for my own school. Learnt a whole lot of app dev (flutter/dart), building a great product, delivering a good pitch and SO much
  more. This was one of my most exciting projects (so-far!)

- **29/02/2024** learnt a lot about "graph theory" and built [Giraffe](https://github.com/aadv1k/giraffe) my own experimental graph library.

- **31/01/2024**: [Finished CS50 Web, CS50 Python and CS50 Web](https://github.com/aadv1k/cs50)

### 2023

(These projects aren't abandoned, I will continue to add stuff if I find it worthwhile)

**21/12/2023** Doing [Advent of Code in Go](https://github.com/Aadv1k/AdventOfGo2023)

I maintain a monorepo of [frontend-projects](https://github.com/aadv1k/frontend-projects), these are implementations of various designs from across the web, the tech-stack ranges from Webpack w/ Vanilla JS, to full-on React apps.

**18/08/2023** [OctetOCR](https://github.com/aadv1k/octet) is a rather simple OCR model (and data preparation system) in C which uses [KNN](https://www.ibm.com/topics/knn) algorithm to approximate an input image with it's labeled training data

**11/08/2023** [swt.h](https://github.com/aadv1k/swt) is a header-only, zero-dependency implementation for Stroke Width Transform, which allows for text extraction from scenes

**10/07/2023** I wrote a [Computer Vision Guide](https://aadv1k.gitbook.io/cv-guide) that documents much of the functions, and techniques I learn about Computer Vision while building [Deimos](https://github.com/aadv1k/deimos) (which is a CV library in C)

**24/06/2023** [Chex](https://github.com/aadv1k/chex) is a simple chess engine, that offers a web + console UI, which I wrote to mess around with C++ and some of the [design patterns](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns) I had been studying

**24/04/2023** [Beaver](https://github.com/aadv1k/beaver) is a CSV data manipulation library written in [Common Lisp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Lisp)

**09/05/2023** Wrote a search query parser [@byod/dork](https://github.com/aadv1k/byod/tree/main/dork) similar to what search engines use; it primarily srves to remove filler words and distill the language into one which is more deterministic.

**14/04/2023** [DracoQL](https://github.com/aadv1k/dracoql) is a DSL (Domain specific language) in TypeScript comprising of an AST built upon a rudimentary tokenizer. The AST is interpreted by the JS and the results are either piped into the namespace (which is really just a Map) or to the `stdout`.

### 2022

**15/12/2022** 🎄 [Advent of Code in C](https://github.com/Aadv1k/AdventOfC2022)

**11/09/2022** Wrote [kevlar](https://github.com/aadv1k/kevlar) a **static-site generator** using pure C, this project comprises of several smaller chunks, each built from scratch :-
- A minimal and fast markdown parser, which you can download -> [md2html](https://github.com/Aadv1k/kevlar/releases/tag/v2.0.1)
- A non-spec [`.ini` parser](https://github.com/Aadv1k/kevlar#config)
- The [Kevlar templating engine](https://github.com/Aadv1k/kevlar#templating), heavily inspired from hugo
- The [default kevlar theme](https://github.com/Aadv1k/listed-kevlar-theme)

**17/02/2022** [Gdoc.vim](https://github.com/aadv1k/gdoc.vim) is a plugin provides google docs integration for the Vim editor, it supports all the CRUD operations from a editor first approach.

**24/12/2021** [Advent of Code in Lua](https://github.com/Aadv1k/AdventOfLua2021)

**05/10/2021** Reverse engineered and [wrote a wrapper](https://github.com/Aadv1k/schoolOS-api-wrapper) for [SchoolOS](https://www.getschoolos.com/), which at the time was the site being used by my school for online classes.
