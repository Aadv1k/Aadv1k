Hey, this is Aadvik, and I love building stuff, including, but not limited to the world wide web or various other fields in CS. I also occasionally write at [aadvik's wicked blog](https://aadv1k.netlify.app/).

## Should be

- Programming every single day

## Now

- Working on an _awesome_ API mocking platform you'll get to see more of in the coming weeks!

## Past

### 2024

- **29/11/2024** Built [Varta](https://github.com/aadv1k/varta) a multi-channel school communications app for my own school.  Learnt app development, customer discovery, giving a good pitch and so much more, it became the biggest project i've done so far. 
- **29/02/2024** learnt a lot about "graph theory" and built [Giraffe](https://github.com/aadv1k/giraffe) my own experimental graph library.
- **31/01/2024**: [Finished CS50 Web, CS50 Python and CS50 Web](https://github.com/aadv1k/cs50)

### 2023

(These projects aren't abandoned, I will continue to add stuff if I find it worthwhile)

**21/12/2023** Doing [Advent of Code in Go](https://github.com/Aadv1k/AdventOfGo2023)

I maintain a monorepo of [frontend-projects](https://github.com/aadv1k/frontend-projects), these are implementations of various designs from across the web, the tech-stack ranges from Webpack w/ Vanilla JS, to full-on React apps.

**18/08/2023** [OctetOCR](https://github.com/aadv1k/octet) is a rather simple OCR model (and data preparation system) in C which uses [KNN](https://www.ibm.com/topics/knn) algorithm to approximate an input image with it's labeled training data

**11/08/2023** [swt.h](https://github.com/aadv1k/swt) is a header-only, zero-dependency implementation for Stroke Width Transform, which allows for text extraction from scenes

**10/07/2023** I wrote a [Computer Vision Guide](https://aadv1k.gitbook.io/cv-guide) that documents much of the functions, and techniques I learn about Computer Vision while building [Deimos](https://github.com/aadv1k/deimos) (which is a CV library in C)

**24/06/2023** [Chex](https://github.com/aadv1k/chex) is a simple chess engine, that offers a web + console UI, which I wrote to mess around with C++ and some of the [design patterns](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns) I had been studying

**24/04/2023** [Beaver](https://github.com/aadv1k/beaver) is a CSV data manipulation library written in [Common Lisp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Lisp)

**09/05/2023** Wrote a search query parser [@byod/dork](https://github.com/aadv1k/byod/tree/main/dork) similar to what search engines use; it primarily srves to remove filler words and distill the language into one which is more deterministic.

**14/04/2023** [DracoQL](https://github.com/aadv1k/dracoql) is a DSL (Domain specific language) in TypeScript comprising of an AST built upon a rudimentary tokenizer. The AST is interpreted by the JS and the results are either piped into the namespace (which is really just a Map) or to the `stdout`.

### 2022

**15/12/2022** ðŸŽ„ [Advent of Code in C](https://github.com/Aadv1k/AdventOfC2022)

**11/09/2022** Wrote [kevlar](https://github.com/aadv1k/kevlar) a **static-site generator** using pure C, this project comprises of several smaller chunks, each built from scratch :-
- A minimal and fast markdown parser, which you can download -> [md2html](https://github.com/Aadv1k/kevlar/releases/tag/v2.0.1)
- A non-spec [`.ini` parser](https://github.com/Aadv1k/kevlar#config)
- The [Kevlar templating engine](https://github.com/Aadv1k/kevlar#templating), heavily inspired from hugo
- The [default kevlar theme](https://github.com/Aadv1k/listed-kevlar-theme)

**17/02/2022** [Gdoc.vim](https://github.com/aadv1k/gdoc.vim) is a plugin provides google docs integration for the Vim editor, it supports all the CRUD operations from a editor first approach.

**24/12/2021** [Advent of Code in Lua](https://github.com/Aadv1k/AdventOfLua2021)

**05/10/2021** Reverse engineered and [wrote a wrapper](https://github.com/Aadv1k/schoolOS-api-wrapper) for [SchoolOS](https://www.getschoolos.com/), which at the time was the site being used by my school for online classes.
