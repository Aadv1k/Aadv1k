Hey, this is Aadvik, I _really_ love writing code! (especially with a good cup of latte â˜•). Currently I am working with **Web Development** and **Computer Vision**. I also occasionally write at [aadvik's wicked blog](https://aadv1k.netlify.app/).

## Now

I am trying to get good at Computer Vision (and Web Dev); This is how

- [swt.h](https://github.com/aadv1k/swt) is a header-only, zero-dependency implementation for Stroke Width Transform, which allows for text extraction from scenes
- Messing around with WebAssembly and CV by building [a web-based document scanner](https://github.com/aadv1k/quickdoc) 
- Building an [experimental Computer Vision library](https://github.com/aadv1k/deimos) in C
- Writing a [Computer Vision Guide](https://aadv1k.gitbook.io/cv-guide) alongside for future reference

## Past

Here are some of my notable projects

I maintain a monorepo of [frontend-projects](https://github.com/aadv1k/frontend-projects), these are implementations of various designs from across the web, the tech-stack ranges from Webpack w/ Vanilla JS, to full-on React apps.

**24/06/2023** [Chex](https://github.com/aadv1k/chex) is a simple chess engine, that offers a web + console UI, which I wrote to mess around with C++ and some of the [design patterns](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns) I had been studying

**24/04/2023** [Beaver](https://github.com/aadv1k/beaver) is a CSV data manipulation library written in [Common Lisp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Lisp)

**09/05/2023** Wrote a search query parser [@byod/dork](https://github.com/aadv1k/byod/tree/main/dork) similar to what search engines use; it primarily srves to remove filler words and distill the language into one which is more deterministic.

**14/04/2023** [DracoQL](https://github.com/aadv1k/dracoql) is a DSL (Domain specific language) in TypeScript comprising of an AST built upon a rudimentary tokenizer. The AST is interpreted by the JS and the results are either piped into the namespace (which is really just a Map) or to the `stdout`.

**15/12/2022** ðŸŽ„ [Advent of Code in C](https://github.com/Aadv1k/AdventOfC2022)

**11/09/2022** Wrote [kevlar](https://github.com/aadv1k/kevlar) a **static-site generator** using pure C, this project comprises of several smaller chunks, each built from scratch :-
- A minimal and fast markdown parser, which you can download -> [md2html](https://github.com/Aadv1k/kevlar/releases/tag/v2.0.1)
- A non-spec [`.ini` parser](https://github.com/Aadv1k/kevlar#config)
- The [Kevlar templating engine](https://github.com/Aadv1k/kevlar#templating), heavily inspired from hugo
- The [default kevlar theme](https://github.com/Aadv1k/listed-kevlar-theme)

**17/02/2022** [Gdoc.vim](https://github.com/aadv1k/gdoc.vim) is a plugin provides google docs integration for the Vim editor, it supports all the CRUD operations from a editor first approach.

**24/12/2021** [Advent of Code in Lua](https://github.com/Aadv1k/AdventOfLua2021)

**05/10/2021** Reverse engineered and [wrote a wrapper](https://github.com/Aadv1k/schoolOS-api-wrapper) for [SchoolOS](https://www.getschoolos.com/), which at the time was the site being used by my school for online classes.
